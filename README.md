# E-Commerce Country Dashboard

> **Note:** This project was originally created during my mid-year break, around early August, when I first started learning Power Pivot and Excel data modeling.

This repository contains an interactive Excel-based **E-Commerce Country Dashboard** built using **Power Pivot**, **Power Query**, and **Pivot Tables**. The project visualizes e-commerce performance based on selected product categories and countries.

This dashboard was created as part of my learning journey in developing data analytics solutions with Microsoft Excel. I started from scratch by learning how to:

* Build a **data model** using *Power Pivot*
* Clean and combine datasets with *Power Query*
* Use *Pivot Tables* and *DAX measures* for calculations
* Design a clean and interactive dashboard layout

The goal of this project is to transform raw e-commerce data into meaningful insights for business decision-making.
